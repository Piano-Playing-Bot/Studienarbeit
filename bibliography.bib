An alternative approach is the immediate mode GUI which differs from retained mode in that no UI widget has a lifetime and does not require updates. In every frame, the application instructs the immediate mode system what to display on the screen. Immediate mode GUI systems are already widely used in games and game tooling. In this work, the possibilities of an immediate mode system in the context of mixed reality are explored.},

Our method has been tested using several handwritten music scores of the CVC-MUSCIMA database and compared with a commercial Optical Music Recognition (OMR) software.

Compared to other lossless (audio) coding formats, FLAC is a format with low complexity and can be coded to and from with little computing resources. Decoding of FLAC has seen many independent implementations on many different platforms, and both encoding and decoding can be implemented without needing floating- point arithmetic.},

However, this field is still difficult to access for new researchers, especially those without a significant musical background: Few introductory materials are available, and, furthermore, the field has struggled with defining itself and building a shared terminology. In this work, we address these shortcomings by (1) providing a robust definition of OMR and its relationship to related fields, (2) analyzing how OMR inverts the music encoding process to recover the musical notation and the musical semantics from documents, and (3) proposing a taxonomy of OMR, with most notably a novel taxonomy of applications. Additionally, we discuss how deep learning affects modern OMR research, as opposed to the traditional pipeline. Based on this work, the reader should be able to attain a basic understanding of OMR: its objectives, its inherent structure, its relationship to other fields, the state of the art, and the research opportunities it affords.},

The limited resources and complexity of the software and hardware needed to ship modern game titles demanded a different approach.Data-oriented design is inspired by high-performance computing techniques, database design, and functional programming values. It provides a practical methodology that reduces complexity while improving performance of both your development team and your product. Understand the goal, understand the data, understand the hardware, develop the solution.This book presents foundations and principles helping to build a deeper understanding of data-oriented design.

The method includes three parts: (1) the description of relationships between primitives by introducing the concept of interaction field, (2) the definition of six hierarchical structure features for analyzing notes structures, (3) the workflow of primitive assembly under the guidance of giving priority to key structure features. To evaluate the performance of our method, we present experimental results on real-life scores and comparisons with two commercial products. Experiment show that our method lead to quite good results, especially for complicated scores.},

After clarifying the difficulties specific to this domain, we propose appropriate solutions at both image analysis level and high-level interpretation. Thus, a recognition and segmentation method is designed, that allows dealing with common printing defects and numerous symbol interconnections. Then, musical rules are modeled and integrated, in order to make a consistent decision. This high-level interpretation step relies on the fuzzy sets and possibility framework, since it allows dealing with symbol variability, flexibility, and imprecision of music rules, and merging all these heterogeneous pieces of information. Other innovative features are the indication of potential errors and the possibility of applying learning procedures, in order to gain in robustness. Experiments conducted on a large data base show that the proposed method constitutes an interesting contribution to OMR.},

The transcribed copy should allow musicians to compose, play and edit music by taking a picture of a music sheet. Complete transcription of sheet music would also enable more efficient archival. OMR facilitates examining sheet music statistically or searching for patterns of notations, thus helping use cases in digital musicology too. Recently, there has been a shift in OMR from using conventional computer vision techniques towards a deep learning approach. In this paper, we review relevant works in OMR, including fundamental methods and significant outcomes, and highlight different stages of the OMR pipeline. These stages often lack standard input and output representation and standardised evaluation. Therefore, comparing different approaches and evaluating the impact of different processing methods can become rather complex. This paper provides recommendations for future work, addressing some of the highlighted issues and represents a position in furthering this important field of research.},

We have conducted studies which have led to algorithms for segmentation of the sound and pitch detection of the individual notes.

Compared to clean, scanned images, low resolution images contain music scores with severe distortions or irrecoverable discontinuities. Most of existing approaches for scanned music scores cannot be applied to the scores with such damages. In this paper, we present mask based approach to cope with incomplete information in the low resolution image. We mainly focus on musical notes in this paper. After the separation of objects in the score into symbols and musical notes, musical notes are identified by mask matching. For the head of a musical note, a 2D head mask is employed while 1D mask is used to extract features for tails. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach with the recognition rate of close to 100\% in sample images.},
